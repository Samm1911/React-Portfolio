## Installation

To install my portfolio, simply open the app and click the icon in the browser search bar on the top right.

## Usage

First, you will be directed to the "About Me" section, which portrays a picture of myself and a short bio about me.
Under my username, you will find the navbar, which will render the different sections of my portfolio.

![navbar](/Users/samgostanian/Sams-coding-projects/20 - React/New/React-Portfolio/src/img/1.png)

At the bottom, you will find clickable icons, which lead to my Github, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter.

Once you click on the Portfolio title in the navbar, you will be directed to the page, that showcases 6 of my projects.
If you hover over one of those projects, you will be able to see the title, which will lead you to the deployed application, once clicked.
Additionally, you will see a GitHub icon, which will lead you to the GitHub repo of the corresponding project.
Under those two, you will find a description, that describes what kind of app is presented here.

Once you get to the contact section, you will find a form, where you can enter your contact information.
If you move the cursor out of the form fields and click, you will see a notification, of which fields are missing.

Also, if the typed-in email is incorrect, another error message will be displayed.

On the last page is my resume, which is downloadable, once the link is clicked.
